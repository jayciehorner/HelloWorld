    To learn more about how our form data is being sent see https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1

    application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
This is the default content type. Forms submitted with this content type must be encoded as follows:

Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in [RFC1738], section 2.2: Non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A').
The control names/values are listed in the order they appear in the document. The name is separated from the value by `=' and name/value pairs are separated from each other by `&'.
