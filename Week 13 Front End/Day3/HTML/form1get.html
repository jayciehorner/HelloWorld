    <!-- FORMS IN HTML -->

    <!-- 
        Forms can take many...wait for it...forms!
        Can be a simple login, a registration form
        Anything where the user's data is being collected and
            dealt with in some way


        We can have the user fill in important information - each will be best suited to a different type of input
            - name
            - birthday
            - SSN
            - phone
            - email

        We can also have them select/input other information
            via non-typing means
            - buttons
            - checkboxes
            - color selectors

        We use different types of tag to collect different types
            of information
            - form
            - buttons
            - input
            - label
            - select (drop downs)

        The <input> tag is critical and can take on many types
            - text
            - date
            - number
            - color
            - email
            - password -- doesn't show what is being typed 
            - tel (telephone number) -- does validation for you
            - radio buttons
            - checkboxes
            - file uploads

        At the end of the form process, the user will submit the form
        
        ONLY inputs WITHIN the form tag 
        will be submitted with the form
     -->

    <!-- A form tag has two important attributes:
            - method = what type of http request method
            - action = where to send that request
     -->

    <!-- CRUD operations
        these are the basic operations we use with databases

        C = create
        R = read
        U = update
        D = delete

        C is done with a POST request
        R is done with a GET request
        U is done with a PUT request
        D is done with a DELETE request

        form's method property deals with GET and POST

        GET - the form-data will be transmitted as part of the url's request parameters
                localhost:5500/forms.html?name=Erica&favorite-food=apples
                localhost:5500/forms.html?username=erica&password=0000 BAD

        POST - the form-data will be transmitted as part of the http request's body
              by default html forms use application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
              which is similar to json
                
                    name: "Erica",
                    favoriteFood: "apples"
                
    
    -->
    <!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->
    <!-- EXAMPLE 1: MAKE A FORM THAT  makes a GET request to Google
         GET says "give me the resource in the action property" -->

         <!-- =====================================================
            TODO create a form that does a GET request to any url to see what happens 
            =======================================================
        -->

    <form method="GET" action="https://amazon.com/search">

        <!-- All other previous tags are still relevant in a form -->
        <p>GET form -- Go to Amazon.com/?</p>
        <input type="text" name="animal" placeholder="cat">

        <!-- Add a button tag to submit the form, 
                - - Add the attribute type="submit"  -- tells the form to send a GET request when clicked
                - - Add the text for the button to display
             -->
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    </form>

        <!-- Notice, not all characters are allowed in urls, because they have special meanings or could be misinterpretted
                so some characters get encoded, for example
                space = %20
                ! = %21
                " = %22

                ( = %28
                ) = %29
                * = %2A
                + = %2B
                , = %2C -- This is a hexvalue so each digit can be 0123456789ABCDEF
                - = %2D
                . = %2E

                @ = %40
                © = %A9
                ® = %AE
